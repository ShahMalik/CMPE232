#### The parable of the two watchmakers


> There once were two watchmakers, named Hora and Tempus, who made very fine watches. The phones in their workshops rang frequently and new customers were constantly calling them. However, Hora prospered while Tempus became poorer and poorer. In the end, Tempus lost his shop. What was the reason behind this?

>  The watches consisted of about 1000 parts each. The watches that Tempus made were designed such that, when he had to put down a partly assembled watch, it immediately fell into pieces and had to be reassembled from the basic elements. Hora had designed his watches so that he could put together sub-assemblies of about ten components each, and each sub-assembly could be put down without falling apart. Ten of these subassemblies could be put together to make a larger sub-assembly, and ten of the larger sub-assemblies constituted the whole watch.

## The Organized Human-Life

Hunter-gatherer people settled down and turned into farmers. Farmers become specialized in some limited type of foods. They needed to exchange their products. This is how trade is born. After a while, too much exchange produced infomation overload. People needed to extend their brains to handle this much information. They invented `writing` to store and process information. After that humans cretae art, science and modern civilization.   

## The Organized Mind
In our digital world, we face again with too much information. Rich people hire asistants to organize their jobs. We, as ordinary people, find our way of handling our jobs. Categorization reduces mental effort.
